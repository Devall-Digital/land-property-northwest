# Website Development Project - Business Overview

## Project Mission
Create a high-converting website that captures leads and funnels them to our business partners, achieving top Google search rankings to dominate the market before competitors can respond.

## Business Model
- **Primary Goal**: Lead generation and capture
- **Target**: First page Google rankings
- **Strategy**: Scoop up all business opportunities before competitors
- **Revenue Model**: Lead distribution to business partners

## Website Structure
The website is organized with a barrier approach to protect work-in-progress content:

### Public-Facing Pages:
- **`index.html`** - Coming Soon page with contact information
  - Serves as a barrier to the public
  - Contains contact details for immediate inquiries
  - Has a preview button to access work-in-progress site
  - Blocked from search engine indexing

### Development Pages:
- **`home.html`** - Main work-in-progress website
  - Full website with all features and content
  - Safe to update and develop without public exposure
  - Accessible via preview button or direct URL

### SEO Strategy:
- Coming soon page prevents premature indexing
- Work-in-progress site can be developed safely
- When ready for launch, simply swap the files

## Current Status
- Website exists with basic structure
- Multiple JavaScript files for interactive features
- PHP backend for form processing
- CSS styling with futuristic design elements
- Coming soon page implemented as public barrier
- Work-in-progress site protected from premature indexing

## Project Structure
This project uses a modular documentation approach with separate files for each aspect:

### Core Documentation Files:
1. **README.md** (this file) - Business overview and project management
2. **DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md** - Visual design, UX, and technical architecture
3. **LEAD_GENERATION.md** - Lead capture strategies, forms, and conversion optimization
4. **SEO_STRATEGY.md** - Search engine optimization and ranking strategies
5. **TECHNICAL_SPECS.md** - Technical requirements, hosting, and performance
6. **CONTENT_STRATEGY.md** - Content planning, copywriting, and messaging
7. **ANALYTICS_TRACKING.md** - Performance monitoring and conversion tracking
8. **DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md** - Development phases, milestones, and timelines

## Development Philosophy
- **Iterative Improvement**: Continuous refinement through recursive optimization
- **Modular Approach**: Separate concerns into focused documentation
- **Trackable Progress**: Clear status tracking for each component
- **AI-Ready**: Documentation structured for AI agent consumption

## Next Steps
1. Review all documentation files
2. Clarify any questions or missing information
3. Prioritize development phases
4. Begin implementation with AI assistance
