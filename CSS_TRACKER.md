    /* Typography */
    --font-primary: 'Inter', sans-serif;
    
    /* Spacing */
    --spacing-xs: 0.5rem;
    --spacing-sm: 1rem;
    /* ... more spacing */
    
    /* Transitions */
    --transition-fast: 0.2s ease;
    --transition-normal: 0.3s ease;
    --transition-slow: 0.5s ease;
    
    /* Z-index layers */
    --z-background: 1;
    --z-content: 10;
    --z-overlay: 20;
    --z-modal: 30;
    --z-cursor: 9999;
}

## Recent Changes

### Last Updated: December 2024
- Created comprehensive CSS tracker
- Documented current file structure
- Identified performance optimization needs
- Outlined accessibility improvements
- **NEW**: Created critical CSS for above-the-fold optimization
- **NEW**: Implemented performance-focused animations with GPU acceleration
- **NEW**: Added mobile-first responsive design with touch optimizations
- **NEW**: Enhanced accessibility with reduced motion support and touch targets

### Recent Fixes (January 2025)
- All inline and embedded CSS in HTML files has been moved to dedicated .css files.
- Created `css/index.css` for styles previously embedded in `index.html`.
- Moved accessibility and skip-link styles from `home.html` to `css/critical.css`.
- All HTML files now reference only external CSS files; no <style> or style="..." remains in HTML.

### Continuous Improvement Process
- Regularly audit HTML files for any new inline or embedded CSS and move it to the appropriate .css file.
- Document any new CSS files or major changes in this tracker.
- Prioritize performance, accessibility, and maintainability in all CSS changes.
- Coordinate with other agents to ensure CSS-only changes and avoid conflicts with HTML/JS branches.

### New CSS File:
- **css/index.css**: Contains all styles for the index (redirect/landing) page, previously in a <style> block in `index.html`.

## Notes for Future Agents

### Important Considerations:
1. **Stay in CSS Lane**: Only modify .css files, coordinate with other agents for HTML/JS changes
2. **Performance First**: Always consider performance impact of CSS changes
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure all changes maintain or improve accessibility
4. **Cross-browser**: Test changes across all supported browsers
5. **Mobile**: Prioritize mobile experience in all changes

### Common Issues:
- Animation performance on mobile devices
- CSS bundle size optimization
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Accessibility compliance
